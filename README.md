# CSci 4409 4Clojure exercise

For this first assignment you should 

 - Fork this project.
 - Go <http://4clojure.com> and solve the exercises listed below, putting your answers in `exercises-4clojure.clj`.
 - Commit your work!

You should do as many exercises as you have time for; we'll be using Clojure a *lot* this semester, so the more experience you have with it here the easier everything will be down the road. That said, I'd like everyone to do at least:

   * Problem 10 - Intro to Maps
   * Problem 16 - Hello World
   * Problem 17 - Sequences: map
   * Problem 18 - Sequences: filter
   * Problem 20 - Penultimate Element
   * Problem 21 - Nth Element
   * Problem 23 - Reverse a Sequence
   * Problem 25 - Find the odd numbers
   * Problem 37 - Regular Expressions
   * Problem 40 - Interpose a Seq
   * Problem 43 - Reverse Interleave
   * Problem 44 - Rotate Sequence
   * Problem 46 - Flipping out
   * Problem 47 - Contain yourself

I'd recommend going through the Clojure(Script) Koans <http://clojurescriptkoans.com/> first, or interleaving those and these exercises. I'd also keep the Clojure Cheat Sheet <http://clojure.org/cheatsheet> up and handy; I use it _all_ the time to look up/remember Clojure functions.
